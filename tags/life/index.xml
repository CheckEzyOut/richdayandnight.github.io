      <description>For the past year, I have attended four camps that are held for a week or less, collaborated with people of whom I had zero interaction with before the camp itself, and learned some awesome things.
The camps I attended are: 1.) Zühlke Innovation Academy, 2.) KAIST EE Camp 2018, 3.) KAIST SoC Camp 2019, and 4.) Accenture Student Leadership Conference 2019 (More details on the camps at the end of the article)  In applying to the camps: Trying doesn’t hurt as much as you’d imagine it would.</description>
