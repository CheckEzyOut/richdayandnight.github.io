      <description>Documenting code is one of the tasks I really don’t want to do, but I’ll do it for the grades anyway.
 This is probably what you’ll hear from me when I was a first year computer science student. I found documenting code boring and useless as I already know what my code does and the only person who’ll probably read it is the professor checking it.
I didn’t understand its importance until one day, I needed to look at that undocumented code I wrote years ago for reference and instead of just skimming through it, I spent a lot of time being quite confused about how I structured the project and even how to run it.</description>
