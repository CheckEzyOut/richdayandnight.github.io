      <description>For the past year, I have attended four camps that are held for a week or less, collaborated with people of whom I had zero interaction with before the camp itself, and learned some awesome things.
The camps I attended are: 1.) ZÃ¼hlke Innovation Academy, 2.) KAIST EE Camp 2018, 3.) KAIST SoC Camp 2019, and 4.) Accenture Student Leadership Conference 2019 (More details on the camps at the end of the article)  In applying to the camps: Trying doesnâ€™t hurt as much as youâ€™d imagine it would.</description>

      <description>Documenting code is one of the tasks I really donâ€™t want to do, but Iâ€™ll do it for the grades anyway.
 This is probably what youâ€™ll hear from me when I was a first year computer science student. I found documenting code boring and useless as I already know what my code does and the only person whoâ€™ll probably read it is the professor checking it.
I didnâ€™t understand its importance until one day, I needed to look at that undocumented code I wrote years ago for reference and instead of just skimming through it, I spent a lot of time being quite confused about how I structured the project and even how to run it.</description>
